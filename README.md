# Csc 220 Project Phase 3

In the main program:

--	Generate a tree with N nodes (N should be random and the range of it should be between 1 and 20) and the value of the nodes should be random too (the range of the values should be between 1 and 40).

--	Display the following menu to the user:

o	Insert new number: this option will allow the user to add one more element to the tree.

o	Print the tree: this option should traverse the tree in preorder, inorder, and postorder.

o	Count the nodes: this option should print how many nodes currently in the tree.

o	Count the Leaves: this option should print how many leaves the current tree have.

o	Generate new tree: this option will generate a new tree which will contain the same number of nodes of the current tree but the value of each node should be doubled (Print the new tree after generating it in preorder,postorder and inorder).

o	Exit: this option should stop your menu from displaying itself and quit the program directly.

--	Notes:

o	Write proper comments on your code.

o	Your code should be neat and well written.

o	Write proper messages for the user.
